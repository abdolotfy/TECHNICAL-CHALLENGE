et3 technical challenge

Before we proceed, please upload the prob1.py file and provide the file you want to extract images from, as well as the destination folder where the images and the CSV report should be generated.

Here's the improved and more formal description of the task:

Task Description:

To complete this task, you should follow these steps:

Upload the prob1.py file and create a dedicated folder for your task, which we'll refer to as the "destination folder." Place the prob1.py file inside this destination folder.

Inside the prob1.py file, specify the location of the file from which you want to extract images. Ensure that you provide the full path to the source file within the code.

Execute the prob1.py script. This script will process the specified source file, extracting images from it without applying any prefixes to the image names.

The script will generate two primary outputs:

A set of images with filenames that match the original image names (without prefixes). These images will be stored in the destination folder.

A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) report containing the following information for each extracted image:

Image name (without the prefix, if applicable).
Image size.
Date of the last modification of the image.
By following these steps, you will successfully extract images from the specified file, store them in the destination folder, and generate a CSV report that contains detailed information about each image, including its name, size, and last modification date.

Task 2 Description:

Objective: To complete this task, you should follow these steps:

Upload the task2.py file and create a dedicated folder for your task. Place the task2.py file inside this folder.

Inside the task2.py file, embed your data or the file you intend to convert to JSON format directly within the code.

When executing the task2.py script, the output file will be automatically generated in JSON format within the same folder.

Estimation:
The values of x and y in the JSON format are estimated as accurately as possible by computing the average values from the entire dataset. However, note that the width and height values remain exactly the same as in the original data.

By following these instructions, you will successfully convert your data into JSON format using the task2.py script, with estimated x and y values derived from the dataset's average, while preserving the original width and height values.

Please proceed by uploading the task2.py file and the relevant data file.
